  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Does jenkins-debian-glue solve the packaging part for me?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>No. jenkins-debian-glue is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for providing a
  <code>debian/</code> directory inside the project you want to build.</p>


  <section id="why_use">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Why should I use jenkins-debian-glue instead of manually building packages?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>There are four main approaches how to build a Debian package:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>build a binary package locally, no chroot/cowbuilder-like environment</li>
    <li>build a binary package locally, chroot/cowbuilder-like environment</li>
    <li>build a source package locally, upload result to build environment</li>
    <li>no local builds at all, changes are committed to a version control system and handled centrally then</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Approaches #1-3 are broken by design. The results might differ depending on
  what's available on your local system (uncommitted files laying around), what
  packages are available on your system (different build-dependencies), how recent
  your build environment is (forgot to update it), etc.</p>

  <p>Approach #4 is the most sane one (only what's available under version control
  matters, centrally maintained build environments, policy and Q/A tests,...) and
  it's the one jenkins-debian-glue is to solve.</p>

  <p>Last but not least - why should you build stuff manually at all? Computers
  are there to do that for you, so why not just commit your changes to the version
  control system and let them figure out the rest for you?</p>

  <section id="vcs">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Which version control systems are supported?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>Currently <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a
  href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> are supported. The author of
  jenkins-debian-glue is aware of people working on <a
  href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</a> support. Support for further
  version control systems is welcome, check out the <a
  href="https://github.com/mika/jenkins-debian-glue/tree/master/scripts">the
  existing generate-*-snapshot scripts</a> if you're interested in how they
  work.</p>

  <p><span class="label label-info">Background story:</span> Git is the version
  control system we're using for the <a href="http://grml.org/">Grml project</a>
  where we heavily rely on Jenkins in our development and release pipeline.
  Development on subversion support was sponsored by <a
  href="http://www.sipwise.com/">Sipwise</a>. By supporting Git and Subversion we
  are targeting for more than 9000 packages available in Debian. representing more
  than 90% of the VCS managed packages. See '<a
  href="http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2011/08/19/use-of-vcs-in-debian-packages-some-stats/">Use
  of VCS in Debian packages</a>' for more information regarding those stats.</p>


  <section id="what_is_cowbuilder">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>What is cowbuilder and why do I need such a thing?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>cowbuilder is a wrapper for pbuilder, which itself is a tool for building
  Debian packages inside a clean chroot. Building Debian packages inside clean and
  reproducable environments is an important step in the philosophy of Debian
  packaging as well as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.</p>

  <p>No worries though, jenkins-debian-glue abstracts all the cowbuilder magic
  away for you.</p>


  <section id="replace_cowbuilder">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Does jenkins-debian-glue replace cowbuilder?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>No. jenkins-debian-glue works on top of cowbuilder (which itself uses
  pbuilder/cowdancer). It neither replaces cowbuilder nor tries to do so.
  jenkins-debian-glue provides the layer between your version controlled Debian
  packages, building them with cowbuilder and integrating that in Jenkins.</p>


  <section id="why_jenkins">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Why Jenkins?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p><a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> is one of the leading continuous
  integration servers, being available under an open source license and a vibrant
  community around it. It provides an easy to use web interface as well as
  enterprise™-ready integration. This provides a perfect continous integration
  system for jenkins-debian-glue to address individual developers as well as big
  developer teams.</p>


  <section id="ubuntu_packages">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Can I build Ubuntu packages with jenkins-debian-glue?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>Yes. It's about building <code>.deb</code> files, not about being restricted
  to the Debian system. You can build packages for Debian on your Ubuntu system
  and also build packages for Ubuntu on your Debian system. Actually every
  distribution should work where cowbuilder &amp; related tools are available.</p>


  <section id="rpms">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Is there support for building RPMs?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>No. jenkins-debian-glue is limited to Debian packages currently.
  If you want to get something like jenkins-debian-glue for RPMs please
  <a href="/contact/">talk to the author</a>.</p>


  <section id="environment_variables">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Why all this messing with environment variables?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>jenkins-debian-glue makes use of environment variables wherever feasible.
  Environment variables are an important concept within Jenkins jobs, especially
  when dealing with Matrix Jobs and Copy artifacts (where you can copy stuff e.g.
  with <code>foobar-source/distribution=$distribution</code>) as well as when
  you're considering usage of plugins like <a
  href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/EnvInject+Plugin">EnvInject</a>.</p>


  <section id="console_output">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Where do I find the console output?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>The easiest way to access the console output is choosing the "Last build"
  URL under the "Permalinks" section at the bottom of you Jenkins job, which
  usually corresponds to http://$JENKINS_SERVER/job/$JOBNAME/lastBuild/console.
  This URL contains the "lastBuild" keyword instead of hardcoding a specific build
  number so you just need to choose reload in your browser to get the most current
  version.</p>

  <p>To locate this URL from the Jenkins web interface choose 'Last build':</p>

  <p><img src="/img/permalinks.png"  alt="Screenshot of permalinks in Jenkins" /></p>

  <p>On the left side on the bottom you'll find a link named "Console Output" then, choose this one:</p>

  <p><img src="/img/console_output_url.png"  alt="Screenshot of console output in Jenkins" /></p>

  <section id="console_output_matrix">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Where do I find the console output of my *-binaries Job / Matrix build?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>Locating the console output of Matrix builds sadly is not obvious. You have
  to visit the according Matrix axe configurations which are listed under the
  "Configurations" section of your Jenkins job. If you have just one axis inside
  your Jenkins job configuration it wil be named "default":</p>

  <p><img src="/img/configuration_default.png"  alt="Axis configuration in Jenkins" /></p>

  <p>Or if you have multiple axes assigned then you'll find them listed below
  "Configurations" as well, like:</p>

  <p><img src="/img/configuration_multiarch.png"  alt="Screenshot of multiarch configuration" /></p>

  <p>Inside the Matrix configurations you'll find the usual "Permalinks" as
  documented in the previous section of this FAQ.</p>


  <section id="slave_nodes">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>How can I build binary packages on some slave nodes and use the repository on a different system?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>Once you start up scaling with Debian package builds with several nodes you
  don't want to include the Debian package(s) on the same node as you're building
  (for obvious reasons).</p>

  <p>The build-and-provide-package script does support such distributed builds by
  using the BUILD_ONLY and PROVIDE_ONLY variables. Usage example for the *-binaries job:</p>

<pre class="example">export BUILD_ONLY=true
export SUDO_CMD=sudo
/usr/bin/build-and-provide-package
</pre>

  <p>Create a *-repos job which gets triggered from the *-binaries job. Don't
  forget to use "Copy artifacts from another project" (copying the files from the
  *-binaries job) there. Assign the *-repos job to the node which provides the
  Debian repository so it gets executed only on the system it should be executed
  on.</p>

  <p>Inside the *-repos job you can use something like:</p>

<pre class="example">
mkdir -p binaries

for suffix in gz bz2 xz deb dsc changes ; do
  mv */*.${suffix} binaries/ || true
done

# if building a tagged version then do not include that one in the release-trunk repository
case "$branch" in tags/*|branches/*) export IGNORE_RELEASE_TRUNK=true;; esac

export SUDO_CMD=sudo
export BASE_PATH="binaries/"
export PROVIDE_ONLY=true
/usr/bin/build-and-provide-package
</pre>



  <section id="multiple_jenkins_jobs">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>How can I add multiple Jenkins jobs for the same software package?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>


  <p>If you need further Jenkins jobs for the same package you can achieve that by
  setting the <i>REPOS</i> environment variable. Let's assume you already have the
  Jenkins jobs <i>foobar-source</i> and <i>foobar-binaries</i> for a software
  package called <i>foobar</i>. To use <i>foobar</i> with different settings as
  project <i>foobar-testing</i> all you've to do is setting the <i>REPOS</i>
  environment variable inside the build steps of the Jenkins job. Usage example
  for <i>foobar-testing-binaries</i>:</p>

<pre class="example">export REPOS="${JOB_NAME%-testing-binaries*}"
sudo /usr/bin/generate-reprepro-codename "${REPOS}"
....
</pre>


  <section id="building_debian_unstable">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>I've problems building Debian packages against Debian/unstable</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>Make sure you're using recent versions of cowbuilder and its underlying
  pbuilder. Some features like '[linux-any]' in Build-Depends might not be
  available in the cowbuilder/pbuilder version used in Debian/squeeze yet, so make
  sure you install cowbuilder/pbuilder from Debian/testing and/or Debian/unstable.</p>


  <section id="initial_cowbuilder_fails">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Building the initial cowbuilder environment fails</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>If you notice 'pbuilder create failed' in the build log then you might be
  building a Debian unstable cowbuilder environment at a time where some
  dependencies cause bootstrap errors. To avoid this manually install the
  cowbuilder base.cow using the command line present in your build log but replace
  <i>sid</i> with <i>squeeze</i> and manually upgrade the cowbuilder environment
  to Debian unstable/sid then.</p>


  <section id="single_repository">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Can I collect multiple Debian packages in one single repository?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>Yes. This feature is provided through so called release builds. In release
  builds you add a release repository name through the "<i>$release</i>"
  variable to the source job which is then handed over to the binaries job. The
  binaries job then takes care of installing the Debian packages to the
  repository as specified by the "<i>$release</i>" variable instead of
  installing them into their own repository. This feature is especially handy if
  you trigger several Jenkins jobs for different (Debian) packages - e.g. from a
  central place (like your own dashboard) - and want to collect all of them in
  one single place (e.g. to get a full release build).</p>

  <p>NOTE: Starting with version 0.5.0 of jenkins-debian-glue it's possible
  to set the path for the release repository using <em>$RELEASE_REPOSITORY</em> (if
  unset defaults to <em>${REPOSITORY}/release/${release}</em>).</p>

  <p>First of all make sure you have the <a
  href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin">Parameterized
  Trigger plugin</a> installed. Then add "This build is parameterized" in the
  source job with String parameters as follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
Name: release
Default value: none
release version if the results should be part of a release (otherwise leave it at 'none')
</pre>

  <p>Enable "<i>Trigger parameterized build on other projects</i>" with settings
  as follows (replace $JOBNAME-binaries accordingly):</p>

<pre class="example">
Projects to build: $JOBNAME-binaries
Trigger when build is: Stable or unstable but not failed
Trigger build without parameters [ ]
</pre>

  <p>and set "<i>Predefined parameters</i>" to:</p>

<pre class="example">
release=${release}
</pre>

  <p>That's it. Now you can replace the "none" with your specific release build
  name when triggering a new source job.</p>


  <section id="foreign_arch_builds">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>How do I build Debian packages for specific architectures/distributions which require specific features on a build host?</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>While building amd64 and i386 can be done on one single 64bit build system
  you can't build e.g. packages for the sparc architecture on the same host any
  longer. To get such a setup up and running you need to extend the Matrix job
  configuration of your binaries Jenkins job to include all the architectures that
  should be supported. Then make sure your Jenkins slave nodes have according
  label names, like "amd64", "i386" and "sparc" so you can assign specific builds
  to specific slaves.</p>

  <p>Then enable the "<i>Combination Filter</i>" to execute the according
  architecture builds only on the according hosts, like:</p>

<pre class="example">
(label=="sparc").implies(architecture=="sparc") &amp;&amp; (label=="amd64").implies(architecture=="amd64") &amp;&amp; (label=="i386").implies(architecture=="i386")
</pre>

  <p>Screenshot of such a configuration:</p>

  <p><img src="/img/multiarch_matrix_build.png"  alt="Screenshot of advanced multiarch configuration in Jenkins" /></p>

  <p>This should give you a Matrix job execution like:</p>

  <p><img src="/img/multiarch_matrix_build_result.png"  alt="Screenshot of matrix build result" /></p>

  <section id="git_snapshot_upstream">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Executing generate-git-snapshot fails with 'Not a valid object name upstream/...'</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>The *-source job using generate-git-snapshot might fail with:</p>

<pre class="example">
+ git-buildpackage -nc --git-force-create --git-ignore-new --git-ignore-branch -S -us -uc --git-verbose [...]
gbp:debug: ['git', 'rev-parse', '--show-cdup']
gbp:debug: ['git', 'rev-parse', '--is-bare-repository']
gbp:debug: /bin/true [] []
gbp:debug: ['git', 'symbolic-ref', 'HEAD']
gbp:debug: ['git', 'show-ref', 'refs/heads/jenkins-debian-glue-buildbranch18981']
gbp:debug: ['git', 'show-ref', 'refs/heads/pristine-tar']
gbp:debug: ['git', 'ls-tree', 'upstream/0.42']
fatal: Not a valid object name upstream/0.42
Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
</pre>

  <p>This means you're lacking the according tag in your Git repository ('upstream/0.42' in the
  above example), make sure to push the tags (e.g. via 'git push --tags'). generate-git-snapshot assumes you're using <a
  href="http://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.import.html#GBP.BRANCH.NAMING">the
  default git-buildpackage workflow</a>.</p>
