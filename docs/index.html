  <section id="trigger">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Trigger Jenkins builds when pushing changes to the repository</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>Once you're happy with the way your Jenkins jobs work you usually don't
  want to click on '<i>Build now</i>' manually whenever you want to trigger the
  build process. Instead let's build Debian packages whenever changes are pushed
  into your repository.</p>

  <p>To avoid polling for updates in VCS trigger the build remotely from your
  version control system:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>If you're using Github for your Git repository the easiest way to get
    remote trigger actions working is using the <a
    href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin">Github
    Plugin</a> with its "<i>Build when a change is pushed to GitHub</i>"
    option.</li>

    <li>If you don't use Github but have your own git repository hosting then
    enable "<i>Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)</i>" option in the
    Build Triggers section. Set a user-defined authentication token so only you
    and your installed hook scripts know how to trigger such a build. The <a
    href="https://github.com/mika/jenkins-debian-glue/tree/master/svn">svn</a>
    and <a
    href="https://github.com/mika/jenkins-debian-glue/tree/master/git">git</a>
    directories of the jenkins-debian-glue source provide examples for VCS hooks
    to trigger remote builds on each commit. (While this approach requires a bit
    more effort to set up you're much more flexible as you can customize your
    hooks as you like. For example building only specific branches, providing
    parameterized build settings and triggering multiple (independent) Jenkins jobs
    </li>

  </ul>

  <section id="changing_branches">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Build packages using different branches</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>You might want to build your Debian package based on a specific branch. For
  Git you could hardcode the branch(es) inside the 'Branches to build' setting.
  But you are much more flexible by using parameterized builds. Depending on
  whether you use Git or Subversion adjust the Jenkins job accordingly:</p>

  <p>If you're using <strong>Git</strong> the enable the '<i>This build is
  parameterized</i>' with the '<i>String parameter</i>' option in the source
  job. Add String Parameter settings as follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
Name: branch
Default value: master
Description: branch to build (trunk, tags/...)
</pre>

  <p>Then adjust the 'Branches to build' SCM settings:</p>

  <p>
  <img src="/img/git_branches.png" alt="Screenshot of git branch settings" />
  </p>

  <p>If you're using <strong>Subversion</strong> instead then enable the
  '<i>This build is parameterized</i>' with the '<i>List Subversion tags (and
      more)</i>' option in the source job. An example configuration looks
  like:</p>

  <p>
  <img src="/img/svn_branches.png" alt="Screenshot of subversion branch settings" />
  </p>

  <p>DONE! Now you should be able to choose the branch that should be used for
  building the Debian source package.</p>

  <section id="different_repos_for_different_branches">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Put different branches in different repos</h2>
  </div>
  </section>
  Additionally to building Debian package based on a specific branch, you might want that
  built packages are put in a branch-based repository as well.
  To achieve that, start with adjusting the Artifact Deployer-Configuration like this:
  
  <p>
  <img src="/img/artifact_deployer_branches.png" alt="Screenshot of artifact deployer settings for different branches">
  </p>

  <p>You should also choose "Trigger parameterized build on other projects" and add
  "Current build parameters" to the parameters. This will make sure, that the chosen branch is
  passed to the binary job. You can remove the usual "Build after other projects are built" trigger.</p>

  <p>Next, proceed with the binary job. Start making it parameterized and accepting the branch
  parameter as done in the source job.</p>

  <p>Now edit the build commands to be as following:</p>

  <pre class="example">
  rm -rf ./* || true
  export sources="${JENKINS_HOME}/userContent/${branch}/${JOB_NAME%-binaries*}-source"
  export REPOS="${JOB_NAME%-binaries*}-${branch}-${distribution}"
  /usr/bin/generate-reprepro-codename "${REPOS}"

  /usr/bin/build-and-provide-package
  </pre>

  <p>Thats it. If you now trigger a build for your source job, it will ask your for the branch and
  will put the resulting binaries and sources into a branch-specific repository.</p>

  <section id="scripts">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Purpose of the scripts</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>The following <a
  href="https://github.com/mika/jenkins-debian-glue/tree/master/scripts">scripts</a>
  are provided by jenkins-debian-glue:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><code>build-and-provide-package</code>: uses the Debian package source
    files (provided and derived from the according *-source Jenkins job) for
    building Debian binary package(s) for the specified $architecture of the
    matrix build using cowbuilder. The resulting binary package(s) will be
    installed in the repository (managed through reprepro) to provide it for usage
    via APT.</li>

    <li><code>generate-git-snapshot</code>: generates a snapshot version of the
    Debian package using git-dch to generate <code>debian/changelog</code>
    containing a list of changes</li>

    <li><code>generate-reprepro-codename</code>: takes a repository/codename as
    command line option and adds an according repository/codename definition to
    <code>/srv/repository/conf/distributions</code> (iff the codename is not
    present yet).</li>

    <li><code>generate-svn-snapshot</code>: generates a snapshot version of a
    Debian package using svn log, svn2cl and some dirty shell magic to get a useful
    <code>debian/changelog</code>.</li>

    <li><code>increase-version-number</code>: takes a version number as command
    line argument and raises the version number for usage inside as a new snapshot
    version. Nowadays the script just adds '+0' to the version number, so when
    running the script with input '0.42' the output will be '0.42+0'. (Disclaimer:
    This script used to be more sophisticated but turned out to fail in some
    situations, the +0 approach usually just works and the script is there to
    provide a central place to handle version number management.)</li>

    <li><code>lintian-junit-report</code>: run Debian package checks using <a
    href="http://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a> and report results in
    xUnit/JUnit format (and also provide a plaintext copy of the output inside
    file <code>lintian.txt</code>).</li>

    <li><code>repository_checker</code>: provides simple access to
    codename/repository and package listings (without the need to know how to
    handle the reprepro repository tool) as well as an option to verify whether
    Debian source packages match with binary package versions.</li>

  </ul>

  <section id="customization">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h2>Customization and Configuration</h2>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>jenkins-debian-glue and its scripts can be customized mainly
  through <a href="/faq/#environment_variables">several environment
  variables</a>.</p>

  <p>You can either set environment variables <a href="#system_wide">system
  wide</a> or inside Jenkins jobs (use <code>export VARIABLE=SETTING</code> in the
  'Execute shell' step accordingly).</p>


  <section id="system_wide">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h3>System wide via /etc/jenkins/debian_glue</h3>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>The following settings are supposed to be configured in
  <code>/etc/jenkins/debian_glue</code>:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><code>KEYID</code>: setting this variable automatically signs repository with the specified GnuPG key ID. Please notice that already existing repositories won't be touched. If you set up a GnuPG key and the <i>KEYID</i> configuration after a repository was created (will be done on first execution of <i>build-and-provide-package</i> for a given binary job) make sure to manually add <i>SignWith: ${KEYID}</i> to your repository configuration ("//srv/repository/conf/distributions//" by default).

  </li>
  <li><code>MAIN_ARCHITECTURE</code>: if you are building Debian packages for more than one architecture you can control which architecture should be used as main one. The main architecture setting controls which architecture should be used as the one providing the architecture independent Debian packages (like <i>foobar0.42-1all.deb</i>). If unset it defaults to the architecture your build system is running.

  </li>
  <li><code>REPOSITORY</code>: the directory where your Debian repository will be placed at. Defaults to "//srv/repository//".

  </li>
  <li><code>TRUNK_RELEASE</code>: if you want to get a copy of all generated Debian packages in one single distribution you can set <i>TRUNK_RELEASE</i> to something like "<i>release-trunk</i>". The repository will be automatically set up if it doesn't exist yet.
  </li>
  </ul>


  <section id="build-and-provide-package">
  <div class="page-header">
  <h3>Supported in build-and-provide-package</h3>
  </div>
  </section>

  <p>The following settings are supported by
  <code>build-and-provide-package</code>:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><code>architecture</code>: controls for which architectures Debian
    packages should be built.</li>

    <li><code>distribution</code>: controls Debian version that should be used for
    the cowbuilder environment (defaults to the host's distribution if
    unset).</li>

    <li><code>release</code>: install Debian package in repository name as
    specified via "$release" instead of the default (being $REPOS), see "<i>Can I
    collect multiple Debian packages in one single repository?</i>" in the FAQ
    section for further details.</li>

    <li><code>BASEPATH</code>: use specified directory as base directory for
    further actions. Defaults to "${WORKSPACE}" if unset. Adjust it if you e.g.
    have a customized "Target directory" in the "Copy artifacts from another
    project" configuration.</li>

    <li><code>BUILDONLY</code>: execute the steps building Debian binary
    package(s) but skip the repository setup/inclusion steps (useful for building
    the package(s) on slave nodes and including the result on a different node
    later then)</li>

    <li><code>COMPONENTS</code>: the specified repository components will be
    enabled when creating a new cowbuilder base.cow. If unset defaults to
    pbuilder's defaults (the underlying system of cowbuilder). Notice that on
    Ubuntu systems <i>COMPONENTS</i> will be automatically set to "main universe"
    (if <i>COMPONENTS</i> isn't set yet) to work around a cowdancer issue.</li>

    <li><code>COWBUILDERBASE</code>: set path for cowbuilder's base.cow, defaults
    to //var/cache/pbuilder/base-${COWBUILDERDIST}-${arch}.cow/ whereas
    <i>COWBUILDERDIST</i> depends on its according variable and <i>arch</i>
    depends on <i>architecture</i> (though doesn't match it if it's set to
    "all").</li>

    <li><code>COWBUILDERDIST</code>: distribution that should be used for creating
    the cowbuilder base.cow. If <i>distribution</i> is set COWBUILDERDIST defaults
    to that, otherwise defaults to the currently running distribution and if that
    can't be determined then falls back to "sid" (being Debian/unstable).</li>

    <li><code>PROVIDEONLY</code>: skip the steps building Debian binary package(s)
    and just run the repository setup/inclusion steps (useful if building the
    package(s) takes place on slave nodes and the result should by included in
    repository/repositories on a specific node then)</li>

    <li><code>REPOS</code>: controls the repository name used for the binary job.
    Defaults to the Jenkins job name without trailing "<i>-binaries</i>" and
    without trailing "<i>-repos</i>".</li>

    <li><code>SUDOCMD</code>: if this variable is set then reprepro and related
    actions will be executed under $SUDOCMD. If the jenkins user doesn't have
    write permissions to the repository and related settings then you might
    consider setting "export SUDOCMD=sudo" in your Build step.</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Reduce disk usage: enable "<i>Discard Old Builds</i>" and set "<i>Max #
    of builds to keep</i>" to something like 15 to keep disk usage at a sane
    level.</li>

    <li>Install and use the <a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Timestamper">Timestamper
        Plugin</a> to get the 'Add timestamps to the Console Output' option in
    your Jenkins job configuration. This is very useful for tracing performance
    issues and timing problems.</li>

    <li>Install and use the <a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Configuration+Slicing+Plugin">Configuration
        Slicing Plugin</a> to perform mass configuration of your source and
